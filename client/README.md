## ✨ Features

For this project I  used HTML CSS, Javascript, and React and an API

## 💭 Reflections

- I learned how to build my own API in this project.
- I am proud of the fact that I am debugging errors and creating forms.
- Decidng which functions and features  are needed for different parts of the app was the most challenging part of this project.
- I would like to add more changes to the page with CSS.
